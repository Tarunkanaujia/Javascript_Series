//Varibales----> 

/* In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that holds data values.
It acts as a reference to a value stored in memory, allowing you to store, retrieve, and manipulate that
 value throughout your program.

 Declaration: You create a variable using the keywords var, let, or const.

 var: Function-scoped or globally scoped, can be re-declared.

let: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared in the same block, suitable for variables that change. 

const: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or reassigned, used for constants. */

console.table([Accountname,Accounttype,Gamilid]); // if you want to run multiple variables at a time so we can use "table"
